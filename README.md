# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand and predict employee turnover based on various features in the dataset.

## Getting Started

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arindal1/employee-attrition-analysis.git
   cd employee-attrition-analysis
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:

   Execute the script to perform data analysis and model training:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   **OR**

   Checkout the **Jupyter Notebook** file [EmployeeAttrition.ipynb](EmployeeAttrition.ipynb).
